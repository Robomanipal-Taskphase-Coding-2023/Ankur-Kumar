Finding the features on which a response variable depends (or not)

Normalizing the features:
    The features are then scaled in order to bring them in range of (0,1) to make better analysis.
    This can be done by changing the value of each feature by


i = 0
j = 0

for i in range(500):
    j = (x-y)**2
print(j)
J = np.sum(j)/1000
print(J)

i = 0
w = 0
for i in range(500):
    w -= 0.01*(x-y)*x
W = np.sum(w)/500
print(W)
