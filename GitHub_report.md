# GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration for projects.

The following are the primary features of GitHub:

1. Repositories
1. Branches
1. Commits
1. Pull Requests

# Repositories
Any project on GitHub uses a repository. A repository can contain files of different types like images, documents, program scrips, etc. related to a project. Most repositories have a ‘Readme’ file that may contain instructions or information related to the project.

Readme Files are written in Markdown Language. The files in a repository are essentially resources for that project. One can choose to set the repository to be ‘public’ or ‘private’ at the time of creation and alter it later.

# Branching
An application can have multiple versions over a period of time. Similarly, branching allows us to create multiple versions of repositories when a project is under development. We can have different versions of a repository at the same time using branching.

## Why is branching helpful?
One can add new features to the project without having to change the source code. Any changes made to the branched versions don’t reflect to the main project until they are merged. This gives you freedom to try new ideas before committing them to main. 

A ‘Branch’ is the duplicate of the main project at that time. Any changes(updates) made to the main can be pulled into the branch version.

# Making & Committing changes
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why you changed something. Commit messages keep track of the changes you have made so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.


# Pull Requests
Pull requests lies at the centre of collaborative work on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colours.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub's @mention feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.

# How to contribute on GitHub
If you want to contribute to someone else's project but don't have write access to the repository, you can use a "fork and pull request" workflow.

A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.
# Communicating on GitHub
GitHub provides built-in collaborative communication tools allowing you to interact closely with your community. 

You can create and participate in issues, pull requests, and GitHub Discussions, depending on the type of conversation you'd like to have.
